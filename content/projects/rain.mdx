<ProjectOverview>
*Rain* isn’t structured — it’s **carved**.

Like the Cantor ternary set, it begins whole.  
Then something is taken away. Then more. Then again.  
What’s left is silence in the shape of a pattern.

This piece removes its own center. Recursively.  
Rhythms drop out. Frequencies fall into negative space.

It’s not music about rain. This is rain rendered algorithmic: broken into recursive gaps, twitching at the edge of rhythm.

  Diagram of the Cantor ternary set — a line broken by subtraction. My sound followed it.

The frequency carving gave me shivers.
