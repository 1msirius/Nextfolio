<ProjectOverview>
The composition of *Rain* borrows from a fractal pattern taken from the Cantor ternary set, where the middle third of a line segment is removed, and then this process is repeated recursively with the remaining shorter segments.

Timbres, rhythms, form, and equalization all follow a middle‑third removal process, creating an unusually fragmented musical experience.
