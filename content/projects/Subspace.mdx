# Fluid Subspaces

*Fluid Subspaces* is an artistic exploration of fluid flow reimagined as a superposition of modal shapes. By isolating these shapes and their singular values, I synthesize corresponding frequencies to create a layered audiovisual tapestry. The work examines how distinct modes—each with its unique pitch and texture—combine to form a dynamic spatial and sonic narrative.

## Isolated Modes

Each mode is represented by a short video demonstrating its distinct sonic character:

- **One Note (mode 25):**

- **Higher Note (mode 75):**

- **Even Higher Note (mode 149):**

## Chord Formation

By superimposing the three isolated modes, the project creates a complex chord—melding these frequencies both in space and audio:

## Scale and Melody

Exploring the tonal range further, I examine the structure of a scale and build a melody from it:

## Timbre and Spatial Effects

Working on the level of timbre, the project also experiments with combining all modes at different proportions, leading to unique spatial effects:

## Abstract Trajectories

Beyond following conventional physics, *Fluid Subspaces* also explores abstract trajectories through configuration space—charting unexpected paths that generate equally unexpected sounds:
