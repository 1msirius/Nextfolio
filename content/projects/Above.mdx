Feeling stuck in place yet compelled to keep movingâ€”that's the emotional core of *Above*. In this project, I experiment with a right-hand part that never seems to escape its loop, while shifting harmonies create a subtle tension underneath. Above that, improvised detuned electronics feel just out of reach.

The album video is a swirling deformation of the original album art. It spins and twists continuously, echoing the idea of being trapped in a repetitive cycle.
