<ProjectOverview>
Feeling stuck in place yet compelled to keep moving—that’s the emotional core of *Above*. In this project, I work with a right‑hand part that never seems to escape its loop, while shifting harmonies create a subtle tension underneath. Improvised, detuned electronics hover just out of reach, reinforcing the cyclical pull.
