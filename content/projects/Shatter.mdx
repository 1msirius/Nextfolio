# Shatter

*Shatter* is an exploration of fragmentationâ€”a stark departure from my work with flow. In this project, clean lines and sharp angles converge to evoke sensations of broken glass.  
 
The work is driven by a simultaneous calmness and piercing energy. By modulating parameters such as the size of the planes and the number of intersections, *Shatter* creates a chaotic but controlled impression.
