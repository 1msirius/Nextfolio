<ProjectOverview>
 What if geometry behaved like tone?

**Spatial Synthesizer** is an experiment in visual modulation. It adapts techniques from audio synthesis — FM and AM, where one sound wave modulates another — and applies them to space.

Here, those waves become **shapes**, and modulation becomes **movement**.  
Adjust the knobs. Shift the frequencies. Watch as ripples interfere, intensify, or dissolve.

Behind the scenes: the algorithm breaks images into waves using Fourier transforms — a kind of frequency vision. From there, modulation carves new rhythms into space.

This is an instrument, waiting to be played.
