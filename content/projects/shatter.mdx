<ProjectOverview>
I didn’t plan this. I tried to hold too many shapes at once, and they all broke.

*Shatter* is not a composition. It’s a containment breach. Planes intersect where they shouldn’t. Tension accumulates until it splits. There is no focal point, only collisions.

The longer you stare, the more it reorganizes itself. Like a memory that insists it happened differently.

It was built algorithmically.  
But it didn’t want to be.

I only liked it after it scared me.
