<ProjectOverview>
*Shatter* is an exploration of fragmentation â€” a stark departure from my work with flow. Clean lines and sharp angles converge to evoke sensations of broken glass, balancing piercing energy with an underlying calm. By modulating plane size and intersection density, *Shatter* creates a chaotic yet controlled impression.
