<ProjectOverview>
I tried to simulate blood spatter.  
Instead, something unexpected emerged.  

*Feathers* was born of an accident.  
Sharp vectors tangled themselves into something fragile, like plumage caught in a crosswind.

Despite my original intent, the result was oddly tender.

This is what happens when geometry misbehaves.

The algorithm didnâ€™t break.  
It just got confused enough to look like nature.
