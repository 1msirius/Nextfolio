<ProjectOverview>
Flow is a second suite of free improvisations created in isolation during the middle stages of the COVID‑19 lockdown. A bit more experimental than the previous COVID album, I experiment with synthesizer and prepared piano, creating a wider variety of timbres to listen and react to.
