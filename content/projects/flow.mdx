<ProjectOverview>
If *Escape* was survival, *Flow* was adaptation.  
Recorded one year deeper into isolation, these improvisations grew wider and more introspective.

Prepared piano, mini synthesizers — I reached for new tools to stretch the boundaries of free play.  
Still unedited. Still one-take. But with more curiosity.

Some pieces are gentle. Others spiral ruefully into nothing.
All of them are chambers I built to wait out the world.

The second winter was longer. But the music got braver.
