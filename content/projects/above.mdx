<ProjectOverview>
I kept cycling through the same notes, over and over.  
Not out of habit, but out of *need*.  

The right hand loops. The harmony shifts. But it never resolves.  
Something’s trapped. 

*Above* is not a solution. It’s a spiral staircase with no ceiling.  

Behind the piano: detuned electronics shimmer, always out of reach. 

This piece is about **the tension between motion and stasis**.  
A runner in a dream.

<FieldNote>
I wanted to climb out of something, but instead, I ended up circling around it.
