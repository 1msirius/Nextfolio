<ProjectOverview>
This began as precision.

One image, coaxed into being by a prompt. Then another. Then another.  
Each time, the same instructions. But each time, more noise. More forgetting.

*Degradation* is what happens when the machine hallucinates too hard.  
Diffusion gives way to dissolution.
The result: a looping entropy. Birds that flock into a melting streak of abstraction. A piano that smears into a grid of noise.

This is what the prompt wanted all along.
