// Or clone your Vercel-deployed template

// Navigate into the project directory
cd Nextfolio

// Install the dependencies
pnpm install

// Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

The server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Configuration

Customize your Nextfolio setup by updating your information to ensure proper SEO, feed generation, Open Graph integration, and other settings.

### Config.ts

Update the site metadata and social links in the **app/config.ts** file. These constants are utilized across the site for SEO, feeds, social links, and Open Graph integration.

```
export const metaData = {
  baseUrl: "https://nextfolio-template.vercel.app", // Update with your site base URL
  title: "Nextfolio", // Update with your site title
  name: "Sirius", // Update with your name
  ogImage: "/opengraph-image.png", // Update with your Open Graph image
  description:
    "A clean, fast, and lightweight portfolio template built with Next.js, Vercel, and Tailwind CSS for optimal performance.", // Update with your site description
};

export const socialLinks = {
  twitter: "https://x.com/1tssirius", // Update with your Twitter URL
  github: "https://github.com/1msirius/Nextfolio", // Update with your GitHub URL
  instagram: "https://www.instagram.com/", // Update with your Instagram URL
  linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/", // Update with your LinkedIn URL
  email: "mailto:example@gmail.com", // Update with your email address
};
```

### Sitemap

Adjust the routes to match your portfolioâ€™s navigation in **app/sitemap.ts** file for SEO optimization:

```
let routes = ['', '/blog', '/projects', '/photos'].map((route) => ({  // Update routes according to your portfolio navbar
  url: `${baseUrl}${route}`,
  lastModified: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
}));
```

### Profile Photo

Update your profile photo by replacing the **public/profile.png** file with your image.

### Favicon

Update your favicon by replacing the **public/favicon.ico** file with your custom icon.

## Analytics

Nextfolio uses [Vercel Web Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart) and [Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/quickstart) to monitor user interactions and website's performance. Simply deploy your site on Vercel and enable both features through the Vercel dashboard.

## Ready!

You're all set! Update your blog posts in the **/content** folder, add your project data in **app/project/projectdata.tsx**, and update your images in **app/photos/page.tsx**.

Your portfolio is equipped with SEO, [RSS](/rss.xml), [Atom](/atom.xml), and [JSON](/feed.json) feeds, as well as analytics. Nextfolio is fully customizable, allowing you to add features as needed.
