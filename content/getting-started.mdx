## Installation

Nextfolio uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for dependency management, so ensure it is installed on your system. If not, follow the [instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation) on their website.

```
// Clone the template code
git clone https://github.com/1msirius/Nextfolio.git

// Or clone your Vercel-deployed template

// Navigate into the project directory
cd Nextfolio

// Install the dependencies
pnpm install

// Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

The server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Configuration

Customize your Nextfolio setup by updating your information to ensure proper SEO, feed generation, Open Graph integration, and other settings.

### Config

Update your site details in **app/config.ts** file. These constants are used throughout the application for metadata, SEO, feeds, and social sharing (Open Graph).

```
export const BASE_URL = "https://nextfolio-template.vercel.app"; // Base URL of your site
export const TITLE = "Nextfolio"; // Update your site title
export const NAME = "Sirius"; // Your name or brand name
export const OG_IMAGE = "/opengraph-image.png"; // Path to your Open Graph image (used for social media previews)
export const DESCRIPTION =
  "A clean, fast, & simple portfolio template built with Next.js, Vercel, & Tailwind CSS for optimal performance."; // Update your site description
```

### Sitemap

Adjust the routes to match your portfolioâ€™s navigation in **app/sitemap.ts** file for SEO optimization:

```
let routes = ['', '/blog', '/projects', '/photos'].map((route) => ({  // Update routes according to your portfolio navbar
  url: `${baseUrl}${route}`,
  lastModified: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
}));
```

### Footer

Update the social icons URLs in **app/components/footer.tsx** file:

```
<SocialLink href="https://x.com/" icon={FaXTwitter} />  // Update your Twitter profile
<SocialLink href="https://github.com/" icon={FaGithub} />  // Update your GitHub profile
<SocialLink href="https://www.instagram.com/" icon={FaInstagram} />  // Update your Instagram profile
<SocialLink href="https://www.linkedin.com/" icon={FaLinkedinIn} />  // Update your LinkedIn profile
<SocialLink href="mailto:your-email@example.com" icon={TbMailFilled} />  // Update your email address
```

### Profile Photo

Update your profile photo by replacing the **public/profile.png** file with your image.

### Favicon

Update your favicon by replacing the **public/favicon.ico** file with your custom icon.

## Analytics

Nextfolio uses [Vercel Web Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart) and [Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/quickstart) to monitor user interactions and website's performance. Simply deploy your site on Vercel and enable both features through the Vercel dashboard.

You're all set! Update your blog posts in the **/content** folder, add your project data in **app/project/projectdata.tsx**, and update your images in **app/photos/page.tsx**.

Your portfolio is equipped with SEO, RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds, as well as analytics. Nextfolio is fully customizable, allowing you to add features as needed.
